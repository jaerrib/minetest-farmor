## Mod Dependencies

- [3D Armor](https://github.com/minetest-mods/3d_armor)
- [Farming Redo](https://wiki.minetest.org/Mods/Farming_Redo) (by TenPlus1)

## Background

Once upon a time, I created a [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) mod that let you make a helmet out of a pumpkin or a watermelon and added it to the local server my kids played on. It was hacky and not practical but amusing. Years later, I've decided revisit the idea and release it for others to enjoy.

Currently adds the following:

- Pumpkin Helmet
- Jack-o-latern Helmet
- Watermelon Helmet
- Pineapple Helmet
